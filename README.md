# MaesonPatches
With the unfortunate and sudden demise of Romhacking.net thousands of patches, documents, tools and information about a large variety of things is going to be lost. That includes my own patches uploaded there. While there's a preserved archive on the Internet Archive, it is far from friendly to browse around, plus while a new alternative could appear in the future it is not a sure thing, and certainly it's not happening any time soon, so in the meantime, I will archive my own patches here.

If I were to update an existing hack, or publish a new one, this will be the place for now.
